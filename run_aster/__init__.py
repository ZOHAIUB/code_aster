"""
code_aster can be used as a standard Python module, see
:ref:`devguide-codeaster`.

For convenience and when code_aster is executed from a graphical interface,
a study is usually defined by a ``.export`` file.
The installation provides a script ``bin/run_aster`` to execute a study
from a such file.

The ``run_aster`` package contains the Python source files used by
``bin/run_aster`` and ``bin/run_ctest``.
