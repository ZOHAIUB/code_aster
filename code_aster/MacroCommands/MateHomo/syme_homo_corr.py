def BuildFullSymmetryMassif(resuin):
    """
    Returns a new result containing the symmetric projection merged with the
    current one.

    This function performs a symmetric projection of the input corrector fields
    along the `X`, `Y`, and `Z` axes, with respect to the Cartesian origin
    (0, 0, 0). The projection is done sequentially along each axis, and only
    nodal fields are considered in this process. The resulting fields are merged
    to produce a comprehensive symmetric dataset.

    Args:
        resuin (MEDFileData): The input corrector fields to be symmetrically
            projected.

    Returns:
        MEDFileData: The output corrector fields containing the symmetric
            projections merged with the original data.
