:py:mod:`operator` --- Generic operators
****************************************

The function :py:func:`define_operators` automatically creates executors objects
(:py:class:`~code_aster.Supervis.ExecuteCommand.ExecuteCommand` or
:py:class:`~code_aster.Supervis.ExecuteCommand.ExecuteMacro`) for operators that
are not already defined in the store, i.e. not already defined in the
``code_aster/Commands`` directory.

It is mainly a transtional feature that should make work most of the *legacy*
commands with few changes.
