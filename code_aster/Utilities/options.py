    Some options are enabled and/or disabled from command line options.
    Some others are internally used by programming.

    - *Debug*: Debug mode.
    - *Abort*: Abort instead of raising an exception in case of errors.
    - *WarningAsError*: Turns warnings into errors.
    - *ForceStart*: Start a new calculation even if a database exists.
    - *Continue*: Restart from an existing database.
    - *StrictUnpickling*: Fail when an object can not be unpickled.
    - *UseLegacyMode*: Create 'CO' objects instead of namedtuple.
    - *ShowDeprecated*: Show deprecation warnings.
    - *ShowSyntax*: Show syntax of commands.
    - *ShowChildCmd*: Show children commands called in depth.
    - *TestMode*: Testcase mode.
    - *SlaveMode*: Execution embedded by another program (do not abort, do not
      exit in case of time limit...).
    - *InteractiveInterpreter*: Indicates an interactive execution.
    - *LastStep*: Last step of a study, database won't be reloaded from the
      temporary directory.
    - *SaveBase*: The database will be copied at the end of the calculation.
    - *HPCMode*: High Performance Computing mode, parallel computing using
      domain decomposition.
